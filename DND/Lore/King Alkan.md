# King Alkan

Dead ancient king whose tomb has been recently uncovered.

King Alkan was the king of [[Torofel]] and a vassal king to the [[God-King Gundran]] of the [[Gar Maran Empire]].  

King Alkan was human as were most of his subjects, but he kept a royal guard of orcs, of which the two most loyal members were turned into undead [[Tomb Guardians]] to protect his tomb.
