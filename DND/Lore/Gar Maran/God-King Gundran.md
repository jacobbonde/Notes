# God-King Gundran

Gundran was the self-proclaimed God-King and last ruler of the [[Gar Maran Empire]].  

Gundran raised himself to God-King and made the worship of him the official and only allowed religion of the empire.

The worship of Gundran caught the attention of the Gods, who eventually brought him and the entire empire down.

* Gundran's god-spirit sundered and "entombed"
* Many idols of Gundran. If "worshipped", Gundran's god-spirit will re-awaken
