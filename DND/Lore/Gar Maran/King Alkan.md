# King Alkan

Dead ancient king whose tomb has been recently uncovered.

King Alkan was the king of [[Kingdom of Torofel]] and a vassal king to the [[God-King Gundran]] of the [[Gar Maran Empire]].  

King Alkan was human as were most of his subjects, but he kept a royal guard of orcs, of which the two most loyal members were turned into undead [[Tomb Guardians]] to protect his tomb.

King Alkan's tomb was re-discovered and opened by a team of four adventures, sponsored by [[House Gaud#Baroness Inessa Gaud]].
