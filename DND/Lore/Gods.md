# Gods

It it often thought that the Gods created the world and all the people in it. This is not the case. Quite the opposite - the Gods were created by the people of the world.

Belief and worship of a god, births and feeds the god. The god will grow in power over time as more people worship. If nobody worships the god, it will very slowly shrink to complete insignificance, but never completetly vanish.

"Dead" gods - those that no longer have any worshippers - often becomes desperate and resort to all manner of wicked methods to retain and even grow their power. These desperate gods will become known as devils or demons.
