# King's Tomb. 
The tomb of an [[ancient king]] has recently been uncovered in a [[forest]]. Nobody has opened it yet, it's known to be dangerous. Guards are posted outside to keep (other) graverobbers away. A [[benefactor]] has paid the team to explore the tomb - she keeps the treasure, they get paid.

Room 1: Guarded by two [[ghouls]], treasure
Central chamber: Stone sarcophagus, treasue
