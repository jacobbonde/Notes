***Trigger:*** Step on the middle part of the tread  

***Duration:*** Instantaneous  

When stepping down on the middle of the tread, the trap will trigger and a small blade will shoot out of the riser into the calf. **The blade deals 1d4 damage** and the victim must succeed on a **DC 13 DEX saving throw** or tumble down the stair and take **1d6 bludgeoning damage**.

***Detect and Disarm:*** **DC 15 WIS (Perception)** to detect the pressure plate in the tread and the hole in the rise for the blade. Plugging the hole will prevent the blade from springing. Wedging something under the pressure plate will stop it from triggering; or the trap can be sprung by activating the pressure plate with some weighing at least 10 kg. If it weighs more that 40 kg it will spring and then reset the trap.
The pressure plate can be avoided by skipping the step, or stepping to either side of middle of the step
