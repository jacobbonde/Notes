# King Alkan's Tomb.

The tomb of the ancient [[King-Alkan]] has recently been uncovered in the [[Marolin-forest]]. Nobody has opened it yet, it's known to be dangerous. [[Guards#Guard|guards]] are posted outside to keep (other) graverobbers away.  
A benefactor, [[House-Gaud#Baroness Inessa Gaud|Baroness Inessa Gaud]], has paid the team to explore the tomb - she keeps the treasure, they get paid 500 GP.

## Entrance

A stone slab covers the entrance. On a **DC 12 INT (Investigation)**, it looks like it has been opened, but put back again.  
Inside is a narrow, steep staircase that leads down to a closed door. There's about ten steps down, and at the bottom is a skeleton lying at the floor in front of the door. It looks like the person might have fallen down the stairs.

### Trap

The skeleton is of a person that sprung the trap on the top step of the stairs. The trap resets itself.
