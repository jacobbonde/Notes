# Nightmares

A merchant in [[Loran-s Oaks]] called [[Jamus Sinter]] has fallen ill and is plagued by nightmares.
His manservant, Mons, will try to approach the party to get them to help. He will offer 50GP, but can be pushed to 100GP.
A [[Nightmare Quasit]] is draining his life every night.

The Quasit can turn invisible.
