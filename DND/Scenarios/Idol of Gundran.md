# Idol of Gundran

A golden idol af [[God-King Gundran]] was unearthed from [[King Alkan-s tomb]] and came into the hands of [[House Gaud#Baroness Inessa Gaud]]. She will pass it on to the collector [[Erlan Strud - The Collector]]. She will want to hire trustworthy people to escort the idol to the collector.
Once the idol is in the hands of the collector, the splinter of God-spirit of Gundran that is caught inside of the idol will awaken. Gundran will slowly corrupt the collector, who will eventually attempt to restore Gundran to life or unlife or godhood.
